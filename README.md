# Analysis of College Rankings using Machine Learning - App Development Files
## By Casey Watkins, Advised by Professor Brad Hartlaub, Kenyon College

These files are most of the required materials in order to run an app which generates custom, weighted rankings lists of
colleges. The inspiration for this project is the prevalence of sites like *US News & World Report* and controversy surrounding
the lack of transparency in these lists. 70% of students believe that ranking lists are neither transparent nor reproducable,
and part of my own research confirms these suspiscions. Thus, I developed this app in order to alleviate some of these problems
and, more importantly, I am sharing my process. The proprietary nature of other rankings lists can be problematic because they
show you the 'best schools' based off these like peer rankings, something which many typical students may not even care about.
Thus, this app can be used to search with some knowledge of what you are searching for.

All data used in the app.R file come with this repository. However, if you want to work through the data cleaning yourself, 
you will need to download the Department of Education's College  Scorecard data, for those files were too large to upload to 
GitHub. However, the cleaned version of that can be found in usedata.csv. shinyapp.R is commented to explain the thought 
process in compiling these datasets. If you have any questions, free to reach out to caseywatkins530@gmail.com. If you want a 
more intuitive demonstration of these files, please visit my app at [this link](https://casey-watkins-apps.shinyapps.io/watkinsrankings/).
